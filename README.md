# 6_legged_spider_robot
This article focuses on the design and
implementation of a six-legged
robot(hexapod robot) that can be controlled
by bluetooth. This robot is developed with a
PIC16F877A microcontroller which perform
as the brain of the robot. Also the operating
functions of each component are
programmed on this microcontroller.The legs
of the robot developed with a single servo
